Dear Reader,

We, the PC co-chairs, decided to start a blog to document our progress in organizing ACL 2017, while soliciting your help and advice along the way.

As you may have noted by our affiliations, I and Min cover the entire world in terms of daylight -- the sun never sets on the ACL Empire -- as we are exactly on opposite time zones with 12 hours time difference.  However, our history goes way back -- we were both doctoral students in the Columbia NLP group, just in adjacent offices.
Back then, papers were still submitted in hard copy via FedEx, conference talks were presented using transparencies, and NAACL had yet to hold a separate conference.  Fast forward to now, there have been many changes to how conferences are organized and run. But the internal workings of the scientific program committee were still a mystery, obscure and unobservable -- a hidden process where only the final selection of papers being observed. Over the years, our model of the internal states became clearer, but certain choices still were not clear and seemed arbitrary.

With this blog, we hope to change this one way process into a two way dialogue.  We will share with you the important policy steps and decision we need to make along the way to finalizing the program.  But perhaps more importantly, we hope to solicit your feedback and ideas about improving the workflow, and as an important side-effect, the scientific program as well.  We promise to carefully consider the policy that you bring up to bring a higher level of transparency to the organization process, but we look for your understanding that our ultimate decisions will not make all parties happy.

Thank you for reading, and hope you'll stay tuned for the next installment!
